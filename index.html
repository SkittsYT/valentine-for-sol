    <h1>Happy Hearts Day, Sol ❤️</h1>

    <p><strong>To: Sol Tohanashi Nazareth Ruhani Maximo Lannister Xiliani Arzadon Legaspi Stark</strong></p>

    <p>Hi, Sol.<br>
    Hindi na ako magpapakilala. Pakiramdam ko alam mo na kung sino ako.</p>

    <p>This message is to thank you and your Ruhani family for welcoming me wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>
    I know we just met, and it’s only been 2 months and 2 days… 9 weeks and 1 day… 
    or exactly 64 calendar days since that day. December 15, 2025, at 3:30 AM — 
    the day you were arrested in a buy-bust operation in Laguna. 
    I was your arresting officer back then. You became my confidential informant, 
    and that’s where everything started.
    </p>

    <p>
    From the very beginning, there was something about you that made my heart skip a beat. 
    Every time you updated me about the case, I felt happy and excited. 
    I remember when you told me you were at Rusty selling, and I even told you I was at the PD and we sent. 
    That simple exchange made me feel closer to you.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sometimes I wish you never became my CI, because I knew it was wrong to fall for someone I arrested. 
    I remember when you told me you were going to start Ruhani and that’s where everything began for you. 
    Even when you were removed as a CI, I still kept texting you.
    </p>

    <p>
    When you became wanted, it was one of the hardest moments for me. 
    I was the one who had to release your wanted poster. 
    I endured it because the evidence was there, and I had a duty to fulfill. 
    But despite that, I still turned my back on my duty for a moment and called you. 
    I know it was wrong. I knew there could be consequences if I got caught, 
    but I risked it just to hear your voice and know you were okay.
    </p>

    <p>
    From that moment, I knew I could never fight
